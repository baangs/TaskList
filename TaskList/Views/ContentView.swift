//since the taskstore file IS the data we want to display, contentview is HOW we want to display the data, in this case as a list.
//we need to supply other views with our task store data, we do this with dependency injection(DI). Remember without some data there is no data to display and content view is the starting/main point in which our data will be displayed.



import SwiftUI



struct ContentView: View {
    var taskStore: TaskStore //this is declares an instance of the taskStore file
    var body: some View {
        List(taskStore.tasks) { //a list of data using hashable/identifiable protocol
            task in Text(task.name)
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(taskStore: TaskStore()) //preview type is using DI for taskstore
    }
}
